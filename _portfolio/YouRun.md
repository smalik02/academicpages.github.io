### Purpose: 
* To create safe, scenic, and personalized routes for runners

### Problem: 
* Running is hard. It’s tiring, painful, and dangerous.  Finding a good route to run is harder. Runners have to balance a unique set of concerns such as distance, safety, and elevation not to mention finding a place that is pleasant to run through. Currently, runners primarily use personal experience to plan their route, but this often results in people running the same route over and over again and is useless if they try to run in a new area. None of the major running apps are able to accommodate these issues. Mapmyrun lets you record your routes and see your pace but gives you no help in making them. Google maps can tell you how to get some place, but there are no guarantees that the way you go will be safe or pleasurable. Route planning sites let you decide where you’re going to run but give you no information as to whether that is the best way to run. There needs to be a better way to plan your run.

### Solution: 
* YouRun is a mobile app that creates safe and scenic routes for runners. All you need to do is input how far you want to run and YouRun will use information such as car traffic, hills, sidewalks, and park locations to map and guide you through a personalized route made to fit all your needs. 

### Why now: 
* 33% of people use a mobile app or fitness tracking device to track their health as of 2016 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/742448/global-fitness-tracking-and-technology-by-age/)
* The leading fitness apps are jogging and running apps (https://www.statista.com/statistics/451489/leading-fitness-apps-among-smartphone-users-in-germany/)
* Major acquisitions of running apps: Underarmour purchase of MapMyFitness (2013) Myfitness pal (2015), Adidas purchase of Runtastic (2015), Fitbit purchase of fitastic 
* Rise in wearable technology and open digital fitness products by partnering with third parties 
* One of the fastest growing categories (https://www.statista.com/statistics/251096/fastest-growing-shopping-app-categories/)
* Very few companies actually plans the routes using data 

### Market Size
* TAM (total runners in US)=65,050,000 people 
* SAM (people who use mobile app to track health*US runners)=21,466,500
* SOM: Based on the data of online ad effectiveness we believe we can get about 1.5 million users in the first year (ad would reach 4700 a day at $50 a day with a 1% average conversion rate)
