#### The What:
* The goal of the app is to provide a social aspect to book reading.
* There are lot of people that want to read, but cannot find a good book recommendation that matches their preferences.
* Thus, we think we can provide a service where people can share book recommendations, order a book, and give a review for the book.
  
#### The Whom:
* The target audience for the app are young & new readers.
  The app can serve any individual who is looking for new books to read. However, we think that millenials and yound readers are a very important market for our app, as many young adults are not reading as much as they want to. Since we are adding a social component to reading, we believe that we can get enough interest.
  
#### The Support:
* We have a support from another student, not at Tufts.

#### Core Functionality:
* The app will offer book reviews focused on keywords and other summary data of various works of literature.
* The app will have two different functionalities, of which we will focus on one. (Still working on this one)
** Users may search for books by searching for different parameters (see first point).
** Users may elect to enter their preferences, then have books sent to them.
* For either solution, a machine learning library will interpret user feedback and adjust their preferences.
* (The app will allow users to search for books using genres and keywords that appear in the reviews)
* (The app will get recommendation based on your preferences)
* The app will allow individuals to track what their friends are reading

#### Secondary Functionality:
* The app offering a subscription based model, where they will get a certain number of book per month. The number of books can vary based on how much they read, and can contain variety of genres.
* Creating a more robust social media aspect, such as spoiler discussions.
* The app will use secondary functionalities including Amazon Reviews API, Goodreads API, Twitter API, Facebook API(?), camera, Python machine learning library, Stripe, and others as needed.
